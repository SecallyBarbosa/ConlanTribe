1. Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

Artemis Financial is a company that gave users access to financial plans. This included savings, retirement, investments, insurance, and more. They wanted to upgrade their communications and operations for users by using secure coding practices. They wanted a more secure way to transfer data, and have data verification. They wanted to do this by upgrading software secuirty algoriithms and principles. They wanted to specifically incorporate assesments that would test vulnerabilities and dependencies. These reports would have to be done in able to find/evaluate the current security risks or vulnerabilities that they wanted to avoid.

2. What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

First I started with thoroughly reading through what the client wanted specifically, making sure that I understand the entire assignment. Next was performing a vulnerability check. After doing this I was able to document any risks that were currently in the software. After seeing this report, I referenced said vulnerabilities to the actual code to try and find loop holes or injection risks. This step is crucial as it plays a part in making sure that the code is secure. It is important to have secure code because it decreases vulnerabilities for attacks/hacks, and means less updating in the future. Having very strong security within the software for a company increases the value temendously. This is because users/customers can trust your service, and employees can work under an organized structure, knowing their work is being done properly. The wellbeing of the company lays within the happiness of the customers, which in essence would happen if everyones data was secure at all times.

3. What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

At first, I found that actually learning how to run the assesment was difficult. After installing the Checksum and learning the steps on how to properly run a code for its vulnerabilites, I was able to find the report. Then the report was hard to read at first, but again, after seeing it a few times, I was able to understand. In the end, every single step ending up becoming extremely helpful.

4.How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

I increased the layers of security by first understand what the risks were. After understanding the risks, I was able to think of and implement the right cipher to decreases said risks which was SHA-256. The Maven Repository was also helpful because it ran dependency checks and helped me find risks in my code by generating a report. In the future I think I would look into better packages and tools that are more up to date and are easier to update routinely. This would always make sure that packages are always updated.

5.How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

I found that the best way to make sure that a code is functional is by actually running it and testing it multiple times after making changes. Also, making sure to save each version of revision makes it possible to go back incase on version was more secure than the other. I would also make sure that this is from a trusted source and would have a Trusted Certificate Authority. After refactoring code, I always feel that the best thing to do is re-run it and test it. Doing this can allow the coder to find vulnerabilities at any time of the coding process. Alos, always running the report for vulnerabiltiies works great!

6.What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

Using and practicing secure coding, referring to the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and using Maven Repository were the tools I mostly used throughout this project. These tools will be extremely helpful in the future as well.

7.Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

I would show a future employer the assignment attached due to the step-by-step breakdown of how I would approach a client asking for specifics like Artemis Financial. The employer would be able to see how I use Hashing Algorithms and use found vulnerabilties to make a code more secure.
